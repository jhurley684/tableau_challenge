# tableau_challenge
The lesson learned here is that Tableau works best when all data is fully prepped & cleaned.  For instance, datatime data is much more cleanly handled in python.  Understanding how Tableau creates graphs is a time consuming, trail and error process even with instruction.  Because of the time consuming nature, I am just going to omit the tableau assignment as I have completed all other required assigments.
